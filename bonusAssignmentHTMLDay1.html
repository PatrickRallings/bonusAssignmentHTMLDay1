                <h4>Assignment: Review of Roles in Tech</h4>

                <p>
                    <b>Cybersecurity:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cybersecurity is the most interesting tech “role” because of its almost
                    limitless potential. Seemingly every aspect of technology, that manipulates
                    data, could benefit from some form of cybersecurity. Networks and other
                    data-driven technologies will continue to prosper from innovations,
                    broadening the already massive scope of cybersecurity’s pervue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cybersecurity is a blanket term which can be applied across a large number
                    of differing roles. In general, cybersecurity relates to programming
                    techniques which aid in the identifying and/or securing of various digital
                    threats. These threats can come in many forms, including SQL injecting,
                    DDOSing, and APTs. Without the aid of cybersecurity, such attacks could
                    cause enormous damages to organizations. One of the many interesting
                    cybersecurity roles is known as ethical hacking. Ethical hacking is
                    essentially the hacking of an organization without ill-intent to expose any
                    flaws in their existing cybersecurity. However, cybersecurity roles are not
                    always so extravagant, and can also extend to much smaller tasks, such as
                    maintaining the security of employee badge information. Like back-end
                    developers, roles in cybersecurity will require proficiency in any relevant
                    coding languages. Cybersecurity developers will also need to understand the
                    fundamentals behind network architecture and a variety of other systems in
                    which they may be securing. Knowledge of any relevant infrastructure will
                    be crucial for a developer to be able to identify any potential threats and
                    secure them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Scrum Master:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The role of scrum master is interesting due to its combination of tech,
                    organization, and interpersonal skills. As someone who has not yet gained a
                    deep knowledge of software development, but has strong interpersonal
                    skills, the role of scrum master currently best suits me. As such, the role
                    naturally draws my attention. Additionally, many of the tasks of a scrum
                    master, such as helping others achieve objectives and conflict resolution,
                    are tasks which I am both good at and enjoy doing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The role of the scrum master is to lead teams towards their goals, through
                    a variety of techniques, while utilizing the Agile project management
                    techniques. From the business to the individual level, scrum masters work
                    to facilitate development, clear impeding obstacles, and open lines of
                    communication for team members. Scrum masters will work closely with
                    product owners and help them plan future goals while maintaining Agile
                    practices. They essentially act as the connection between the project
                    managers and development teams. One of the most important tasks of a scrum
                    master is that of being an effective coach for their team members. Without
                    effective coaching, teams would lose efficiency and effectiveness. Scrum
                    masters benefit from having a strong understanding of full-stack
                    development and/or whatever projects their teams are working on as well as
                    proficient knowledge of the agile project management techniques.
                    Additionally, scrum masters should have good organization skills, be able
                    to effectively communicate, have empathetic tendencies, and be great at conflict resolution.

                    <b>Back-End Development:</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The role of back-end development is interesting due to its role in
                    providing effective programming solutions in the interest of speed and
                    efficiency. Finding solutions to problems has always been a great area of
                    interest and confidence for me. Furthermore, front-end coding could be
                    ambiguous in its potential, due to the subjective nature of design and
                    practicality, while back-end benchmarks would be based in efficiency and
                    therefore definite, which is a quality that I value in objectives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back-end development, otherwise known as server-side development, is
                    essentially the development and/or manipulation data “behind the scenes” of
                    software. In the metaphor of a vehicle, the front-end would be the design
                    of the car, such as the body shape, while the back-end would be the cars
                    engine. Development in the back-end will usually involve working with
                    databases, languages, and frameworks. It will lay the foundational code
                    that then enables specific processes to take place based off manipulations
                    in the client-facing front-end. The top back-end programming languages
                    include Java, PHP, and .NET, each of which have correlating frameworks to
                    utilize for efficiency. Back-end developers should be proficient in one or
                    more of the aforementioned languages, or other back-end optimized
                    languages, as well as be familiar with the relevant frameworks. Back-end
                    developers will also likely need to know how to manage APIs, or application
                    program interfaces, and be able to manage databases, among a variety of
                    other concepts.

        <ul>
            <li><b>Git</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Terminal-based software program that allows you to manage your version control (most common)</li>
                <li>is incredibly vital to becoming a developer or anyone that works with code</li>
                <li>GitHub itself will also be very useful in this class as well as in the future</li>
                <li>Terminal on computer uses Git through the shell GitBash (in our case)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </br>
            <li>Centralized Version Control
            <ul>
                <li>Essentially the way that we manage different versions of code (especially when working with other people)</li>
                <li>Versions are stored in repositories (See repository)</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </br>
            <li>Repository
            <ul>
                <li>The area/folder where your code is stored</li>
                <li>Creating a repository (repo) using Git is essentially just flagging a regular folder as a repo so that Git can know which file to tracked</li>
                <li>There are local repositories, on each person's computer, and then the main repository</li>
                <li>You &quot;push&quot; any differences whenever you make changes to some code</li>
                <li>Local repositories are also updated by server (main) repository changes as well</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </br>
            <li>GitHub
            <ul>
                <li>Where your git projects are stored</li>
                <li>Cloud service for storing and accessing your own or other's repositories</li>
                <li>Even major companies, like Adobe, will store their code and frameworks on GitHub</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </br>
            <li>Local vs Remote Repository
            <ul>
                <li>Pushing is adding files to the remote repository after they have been committed in a developer's local repository</li>
                <li>Committing is telling Git and the non-local repository to track a stated file
                <ul>
                    <li>Basically telling Git which files you are going to push into the remote repository</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Pushing up is updating the remote repository (master copy) after committing</li>
                <li>Cloning will make a copy of the data within files as well as the repository
                <ul>
                    <li>Any changes into a clone could also be pushed into the main repository eventually</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Pull request is basically asking for the local repository to update according to the changes in the remote repository
                <ul>
                    <li>Example: You've made changed to some code but don't have the access to push the changes directly into the remote repository, so you request that the remote repository highlight all of your changes and allows other developers to also look at and comment on the changes</li>
                    <li>GitHub is very valuable when it comes to  pull requests</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Merged is when you actually &quot;merge&quot; the code from your local repository and remote repository
                <ul>
                    <li>This step isn't really needed if you are only working with your own code by yourself</li>
                    <li>You push code, but you merge branches</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Forking is essentially a point where code is copied and then changed to go into a new direction
                <ul>
                    <li>Can sometimes eventually be pushed/merged back into the original, but often is not</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                </br>
                </br>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Open Source
            <ul>
                <li>When developer allows their code to be publicly visible</li>
                <li>Can be a great way to crowdsource different opportunities
                <ul>
                    <li>Freelancers or hobbyists can fork the open source code, creating a potentially improved product (and sometimes the originally developer will want to add that new code into the original product)</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Open source does not always mean that you can just take that code and add to it and then make money off of that</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            </br>
            <li>Git Basic Commands
            <ul>
                <li>&quot;git init&quot;
                <ul>
                    <li>This folder and any directories within it will be a get repo</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>&quot;git clone&quot;
                <ul>
                    <li>You can use this command in tandem with a repo's url to copy that whole repo and place it into the folder you are currently in</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>&quot;git add&quot;
                <ul>
                    <li>This is how you add files to be tracked before you actually commit them</li>
                    <li>You can still remove or change these files before you commit them</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>&quot;git commit&quot;
                <ul>
                    <li>This is how you actually tell the computer you want some changes to be made to a repository</li>
                    <li>This will make any changes to your code accessible to others</li>
                    <li>Not actually merging any branches</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>&quot;-m&quot;
                <ul>
                    <li>Allows you to add a message when used as an option in tandem with commit and other commands</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>&quot;git push&quot;
                <ul>
                    <li>Actually integrating commits into a master copy or branch</li>
                    <li>Usually won't have the ability to push into a master repo until you are a higher-level employee
                    <ul>
                        <li>You can request to be able to push in these scenarios</li>
                        <li>Sometimes you will have the ability to push into branches instead</li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>&quot;git pull&quot;
                <ul>
                    <li>Pulls any changes from your local repository and the master (remote)</li>
                    <li>Doesn't actually make any changes to your code, just gives you the changes that have been made</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>&quot;git checkout&quot;
                <ul>
                    <li>Changes which branch you are currently tracking and located in</li>
